Added two charts under research showing the total electrical energy consumption (i.e., sold) and renewable energy production in Florida. The charts were put under the research tab, since presumably they would tie into the motivation/outcomes of the research being conducted in the field. Another logical holding spot would be Energy Economy, since they tie into consumption and production.  For electricity consumption, a **[LineChart] (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart)** was chosen as the graph of choice since the data shows how electrical consumption in Florida has changed each year from 1960 to 2016. 
Add two charts to redesign project, using provided data below. One chart shows annual renewable energy production in Florida, and the other shows annual total electricity consumption in Florida. These charts can be added to an existing page in your site where they would make sense, or you can add a new page (/data maybe?) to hold the charts. If you add an additional page, it of course should share basic design with the rest of the site, e.g. header, nav, footer.
Select the chart type you feel best suits data. Use at least 3 configuration options to customize charts' appearances.
